Good morning Sir, 
My name is Shradha Patil.  
I hail from Pune where I completed my schooling following which I did my Bachelor of Enginnering in IT from IIT bombay in 2010.  
I love singing and have participated in various events during my school and college days. 
I also enjoy dancing and it works as a wonderful stress buster for me . 
In next five years, I would like to become a complete  technomanager with exposure to all the aspects of a software development lifecycle, leading  a team pf young motivated engineers.  
10 years from now, I visualise myself as a well established professional in the  IT sector having worked with market leading organisation.
It has always been my desire to add value to society in some way or the other and I would like to dedicate some time 
and  myself for the lesser privileged in the society especially women and children. 
In the process, I would like to  symbiotically grow with the organisation and become and become a valuable asset to the  company.
